After watching two people who ordered after me be handed their food, I asked where mine was.

But neither cashier was anywhere near those controls, and the manager was the one serving food to customers and clearing the boards.\\\\nThe manager was rude when giving me my order.

I\\'ve worked at more than one location. I expect bad days, bad moods, and the occasional mistake. But I have yet to have a decent experience at this store.
