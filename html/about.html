        <h3>Who we are and how we got here</h3>
        <p>Researchers critical of the persistent 'AI hype' – driven by flashy headlines and corporate communications –
            have pointed to the harmful effects that misrepresentations of AI in the media might have on public
            perceptions of the technology.</p>
        <p>AI hype monitor is an automated monitor of AI hype content, based on a predetermined classification system of
            particularly problematic metaphors and comparisons common in news articles about AI that circulate on social
            media.</p>

        <h3>How to interpret the results</h3>
        <p>Please be aware that our models, like any scientific ones, could produce false positives. The aim of AI hype
            monitor is to call for attention and provoke thoughts on the narratives and representations of AI in public
            news articles on the Internet. It by no means should be used as a rule of thumb for classifying AI hype
            contents.</p>
