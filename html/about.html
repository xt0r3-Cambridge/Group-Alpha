        <h3>Who we are and how we got here</h3>
        <p>Researchers critical of the persistent 'AI hype' – driven by flashy headlines and corporate communications –
            have pointed to the harmful effects that misrepresentations of AI in the media might have on public
            perceptions of the technology.</p>
        <p>The AI hype monitor is an automated monitor of AI hype content, based on a predetermined classification system of
            particularly problematic metaphors and comparisons common in news articles about AI that circulate on social
            media.</p>

        the narratives and representations of AI in the media, especially the news. It should be used as the beginning of analysis, and not taken as truth.</p>
