        <p>Researchers critical of the persistent 'AI hype' – driven by flashy headlines and corporate communications –
            have pointed to the harmful effects that misrepresentations of AI in the media might have on public
            perceptions of the technology.</p>
        <p>The AI hype monitor is an automated monitor of AI hype content, based on a predetermined classification system of
            particularly problematic metaphors and comparisons common in news articles about AI that circulate on social
            media.</p>

        <h2 style="font-size: 20px">How to interpret the results</h2>
        <p>Our models may produce false positive or false negative results. The intention of this model is to provoke thought and raise awareness about
            the narratives and representations of AI in the media, especially the news. It should be used as the beginning of analysis, and not taken as truth.</p>
