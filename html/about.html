        <h2 class="about-h2">About the AI Hype Monitor</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 15px; text-align: justify;">The AI Hype Monitor is an automated content-screening tool that
            flags up potentially hyped-up headlines, posts, and articles about artificial intelligence (AI), drawing
            on a predetermined classification of particularly problematic metaphors, hyperboles, and comparisons
            [<a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~sayashk/ai-hype/ai-reporting-pitfalls.pdf">1</a>,

        <h2 class="about-h2">Why use the AI Hype Monitor</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 15px; text-align: justify;">Researchers critical of the persistent ‘AI hype’ – driven by
            flashy headlines and corporate communications –
            have pointed to the harmful effects that misrepresentations of AI in the media might have on public
            perceptions of the technology. By flagging up AI hype content, the tool directs the user’s attention to this
            issue and points them to useful, verified sources on the nature, benefits, and harms of AI. </p>

        <h2 class="about-h2">How to interpret the results</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 15px; text-align: justify;">Our models may produce false positive or false negative
            results. The purpose of this tool is to provoke thought and raise awareness about the narratives and
            representations of AI in the media, especially the news. It should be used as the beginning of analysis,
            and not taken as truth.</p>
